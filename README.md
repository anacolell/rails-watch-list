## Organize your favourite movies in lists

* This app is built with Ruby on Rails using a postgres database and deployed on Heroku. 

* It has an MVC design pattern: there is a movie model, list model, bookmark model and review model.

* Users can create a list, upload a picture to illustrate the cover (images are host on Cloudinary) and add movies to it from a list fetched from the TMDB API. Users can also leave a review for each movie.
